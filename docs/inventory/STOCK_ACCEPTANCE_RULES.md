# STOCK ACCEPTANCE RULES — IMS 2.0

## Purpose
Ensure stock acceptance is **verifiable, accountable, and auditable**.

Stock acceptance is a **control gate**, not a formality.

## ACCEPTANCE PRE-CONDITIONS

Before acceptance, Store Manager must verify:
1. Physical quantity
2. Barcode presence
3. SKU correctness
4. MRP vs Offer Price logic
5. Location assignment

No partial acceptance without justification.

## BARCODE GOVERNANCE

- Barcodes are printed ONLY at store level
- Incoming stock must have:
  - No retail price tags
  - No barcodes from source
- Store prints fresh barcode with:
  - SKU
  - Store code
  - Display location

## LOCATION MAPPING

Each accepted item must be assigned:
- Counter / Shelf / Cabinet code
- Example: C1, S3, CAB-2

Location change later:
