# INVENTORY GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLES — IMS 2.0

## Core Belief
Inventory errors are **system risks**, not staff mistakes.

Governance focuses on:
- Visibility
- Traceability
- Responsibility

---

## PRINCIPLE 1 — NO SILENT CORRECTIONS

- No auto stock fixes
- No hidden adjustments
- Every correction requires reason

---

## PRINCIPLE 2 — TIME BINDS RESPONSIBILITY

- Stock age tracked
- Responsibility shifts over time
- Old stock creates visibility, not blame

---

## PRINCIPLE 3 — ROLE-BOUND ACTIONS

| Action | Allowed Role |
|------|--------------|
Stock Acceptance | Store Manager |
Manual Adjustment | Admin |
Force Correction | Superadmin |

---

## PRINCIPLE 4 — AUDIT-FIRST DESIGN

- Every movement logged
- Every exception recorded
- Every override visible

---

## PRINCIPLE 5 — AI IS ADVISORY ONLY

AI may:
- Detect patterns
- Flag anomalies
- Suggest reviews

AI may NOT:
- Modify stock
- Block sales
- Notify staff
