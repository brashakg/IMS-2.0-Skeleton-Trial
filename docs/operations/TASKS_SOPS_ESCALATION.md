# TASKS, SOPs & ESCALATION ENGINE — IMS 2.0

## Purpose
To ensure:
- Nothing falls through cracks
- Accountability is enforced
- Timelines are respected
- Escalations are automatic, not emotional

This system replaces verbal follow-ups.

---

## 1. TASK TYPES

Tasks can be created from:
- Manual assignment
- Expense violations
- Advance overdue
- Stock mismatch
- Order delay
- Audit flags
- AI insights (read-only suggestions)

Each task has:
- Category
- Priority
- SLA
- Owner
- Escalation path

---

## 2. TASK CREATION RULES

Tasks must include:
- Mandatory category
- Mandatory reason
- Optional note
- Auto-generated context link (order / expense / stock / employee)

Tasks cannot exist without ownership.

---

## 3. PRIORITY LEVELS (SYSTEM ENFORCED)

- P1 — Critical (Red)
- P2 — High (Orange)
- P3 — Normal (Yellow)
- P4 — Low (Blue)

Colors are **non-customizable**.

---

## 4. SLA ENGINE

Each task has:
- Default SLA (hours/days)
- Role-based SLA override (Superadmin only)

If SLA breached:
- Auto escalation
- Notification
- Audit entry

---

## 5. ESCALATION MATRIX

Example:
- Staff → Store Manager → Area Manager → Admin → Superadmin

Escalation happens when:
- SLA breached
- Task rejected
- Task ignored

Escalations cannot be muted.

---

## 6. SOP LINKAGE

Each task category can be linked to:
- SOP document
- Step-by-step resolution checklist

Example:

- Expense abuse → SOP-FIN-002

Completion requires checklist confirmation.

---

## 7. TASK STATES

- Open
- In Progress
- Blocked (reason mandatory)
- Completed
- Escalated

No silent closure allowed.

---

## 8. VISIBILITY RULES
