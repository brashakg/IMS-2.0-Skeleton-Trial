# AI GOVERNANCE & REGULATORY INTELLIGENCE — IMS 2.0

## Purpose
Use AI as an **advisor, analyst, and early-warning system**
WITHOUT allowing execution, automation, or silent changes.

---

## AI ROLE (STRICT)

AI can:
- Observe
- Analyze
- Detect patterns
- Suggest actions

AI CANNOT:
- Execute actions
- Modify data
- Approve decisions
- Communicate with staff
- Bypass authority

AI is **read-only** and **Superadmin-only**.

---

## REGULATORY INTELLIGENCE

AI continuously watches for:
- GST rule changes
- Accounting standard updates
- Labour law changes
- Marketplace policy updates

AI produces:
- Impact summary
- Affected modules
- Suggested configuration changes
- Risk severity

No auto-implementation.

---

## AI OUTPUT TYPES

- Insight Cards
- Risk Flags
- Policy Suggestions
- Simulation Results
- “What could go wrong” scenarios

All outputs are:
- Timestamped
- Non-binding
- Auditable

---

## AI CHANGE PROPOSALS

Flow:
1. AI proposes change
2. Superadmin reviews
3. Approval or rejection
4. Manual implementation only

AI proposals cannot auto-apply.

---

## GOVERNANCE SAFEGUARDS

- AI outputs logged
- No black-box actions
- No probabilistic execution
- No staff-level access
- Kill-switch available

---

## FAILURE MODES

If AI misbehaves:
- Disable module
- Preserve logs
- No data corruption risk
