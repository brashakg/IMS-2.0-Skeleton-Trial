# AI FINANCE GOVERNANCE — IMS 2.0

## Purpose
To ensure the system remains compliant with:
- Government notifications
- GST law changes
- Accounting standards
- Market practices

WITHOUT allowing autonomous changes.

AI is an **advisor**, not an executor.

---

## 1. AI SCOPE IN FINANCE (STRICT)

AI is allowed to:
- Read financial data
- Read configuration rules
- Track regulatory updates
- Compare law vs system behavior
- Simulate impact of changes
- Recommend actions

AI is NOT allowed to:
- Change GST rates
- Modify ledger rules
- Unlock periods
- Alter invoices
- Push code
- Override approvals

---

## 2. REGULATORY INPUT SOURCES (LOGICAL)

AI continuously tracks:
- GST Council notifications
- CBIC circulars
- RBI circulars (payments, EMI, BNPL)
- Income Tax updates (TDS, advances)
- Accounting standards updates (Ind AS)

NOTE:
- Sources are configurable
- AI citations mandatory in every suggestion

---

## 3. AI CHANGE DETECTION MECHANISM

AI compares:
- Current system rules
vs
- New regulation or market update

Example detections:
- GST rate change on eyewear category
- New GST reporting format
- Change in e-invoice threshold
- New expense deductibility rules
- New payment compliance norms

---

## 4. AI OUTPUT FORMAT (FIXED)

Every AI suggestion must include:

1. **Change Summary**
2. **Source & Citation**
3. **Affected Modules**
4. **Risk if Ignored**
5. **Impact Simulation**
6. **Recommended Action**
7. **Urgency Level**

No free-form suggestions allowed.

---

## 5. APPROVAL WORKFLOW

AI suggestions flow as:

AI → Superadmin Review → (Optional) Admin / Accountant Review → Manual System Update

Rules:
- AI cannot bypass approvals
- AI cannot auto-apply
- AI cannot notify staff directly

---

## 6. VERSIONED FINANCE CONFIGURATION

Finance rules are versioned:
- Each change creates a new version
- Previous versions retained
- AI can compare versions over time

---

## 7. EXAMPLES
