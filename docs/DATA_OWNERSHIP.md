# Data Ownership & Visibility – IMS 2.0

This document defines who owns data and who can view it.

Principles:
- Data is owned by the organization, not individuals
- Visibility is role-based and need-driven
- Employees see only what affects them
- Managers see what they are accountable for
- HQ sees aggregated and detailed data
- Superadmin sees everything

Sensitive Data Categories:
- Salary and incentives
- Clinical prescriptions
- Financial adjustments
- Vendor pricing
- Audit logs

Visibility rules are enforced strictly and defined in SYSTEM_INTENT.md.
