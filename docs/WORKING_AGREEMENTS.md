# Working Agreements – IMS 2.0

These agreements define how this repository and system should be worked on.

1. SYSTEM_INTENT.md is the highest authority.
   No feature, screen, or rule may contradict it.

2. All changes must preserve:
   - Auditability
   - Role boundaries
   - Non-negotiables

3. No shortcuts for speed that compromise:
   - Data integrity
   - Clinical safety
   - Financial correctness

4. Experimental features must:
   - Be gated behind Superadmin approval
   - Never affect production data silently

5. AI systems are advisory by default.
   Execution requires explicit approval.

6. Documentation must be updated with any behavior change.

7. If unsure, block the action and escalate.

These agreements apply to:
- Humans
- AI tools
- Future developers
