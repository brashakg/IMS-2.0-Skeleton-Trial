# Event Model – IMS 2.0

IMS 2.0 is designed as an event-driven system.

Examples of events:
- Sale created
- Discount overridden
- Stock mismatch detected
- Prescription edited
- Expense submitted
- Vendor SLA breached
- Task overdue
- Attendance anomaly detected

Events:
- Trigger tasks
- Update dashboards
- Feed intelligence
- Create audit trails

No important action should exist without an event.
Event handling rules are defined in SYSTEM_INTENT.md.
