- Workshop Manager insight

---

## PATTERN 2 — FAST COMPLETION FLAGS

Pattern:
- Unrealistically fast fittings

Detection:
- Time deviation analysis

Action:
- Admin visibility

---

## PATTERN 3 — DAMAGE MISCLASSIFICATION

Pattern:
- Damage marked as “customer fault” repeatedly

Detection:
- Reason clustering

Action:
- Escalation for review
