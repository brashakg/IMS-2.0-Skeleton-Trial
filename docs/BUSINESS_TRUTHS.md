# Business Truths – IMS 2.0

This document captures real-world truths that the system must respect,
even when they are inconvenient or messy.

These truths override “ideal software assumptions”.

Business Truths:
- Customers pay in parts (advance + delivery), not always cleanly
- Staff often operate under pressure and make mistakes
- Inventory is fashion-driven; overstock and non-moving stock are constant risks
- Vendors delay, mis-ship, or ignore follow-ups
- Clinical decisions are situational, not formulaic
- Discounts are emotional, not purely logical
- WhatsApp historically filled gaps where systems failed
- Accountability matters more than speed
- Visibility prevents theft more than policing
- SOPs must be enforced gently, not brutally

If a feature conflicts with these truths, the feature must adapt — not the business.
