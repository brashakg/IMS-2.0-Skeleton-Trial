# Finance & Compliance Screens Index

This file represents the root entry for all finance-related screens.

The Finance module governs:

- Payment reconciliation and outstanding tracking
- Expense approvals and reimbursements
- Salary and advance payouts
- GST and statutory compliance locks
- Controlled overrides by Admin or Superadmin
- Full audit trails for all financial actions
- Data export to accounting systems

Finance rules are strict, traceable, and non-negotiable.
All enforcement logic is defined in
