# Tasks & SOP Screens Index

This file represents the root entry for all task and SOP-related screens.

The Tasks module governs:

- System-generated tasks triggered by events, delays, or violations
- Manual task assignment across roles
- Cross-store and cross-department delegation
- Priority classification and urgency levels
- Visual urgency indicators using system-enforced colors
- SLA tracking and escalation matrices
- Completion verification and audit trails

Tasks replace informal WhatsApp-based coordination.

All task logic, escalation paths, and enforcement rules are defined in
`docs/SYSTEM_INTENT.md`.
