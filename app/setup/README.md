# Setup Hub

This folder represents the central setup hub for IMS 2.0.

Setup includes:
- Employee onboarding and role configuration
- Store creation and control
- Product category definitions
- Third-party integrations

Setup is intentionally detailed and restrictive to prevent downstream issues.
Only Admin and Superadmin roles have access.

All setup rules are defined in
`docs/SYSTEM_INTENT.md`.
