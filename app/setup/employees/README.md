# Employee Setup

This module handles onboarding and configuration of employees.

Includes:
- Role assignment
- Permission scoping
- Store linking
- Visibility rules
- AI access restrictions

Setup is intentionally detailed and strict to prevent misuse later.

Employee setup is controlled by Admin and Superadmin only.
