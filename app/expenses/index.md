# Expenses & Reimbursements Screens Index

This file represents the root entry for all expense-related screens.

The Expenses module governs:

- Employee expense submissions
- Bill and receipt uploads
- Hierarchical approval workflows
- Role-based visibility of expenses
- Linking expenses to salary or reimbursement cycles
- Audit trails and finance reconciliation

Expense behavior integrates tightly with HR and Finance modules.
