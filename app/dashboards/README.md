# Dashboards Module

This module contains all dashboard screens across roles.

Dashboards are:
- Role-specific
- Context-aware (store, HQ, superadmin)
- Non-customizable in colors (system-enforced urgency)
- AI-augmented but AI remains read-only unless approved by Superadmin

Dashboards covered:
- Staff Dashboard
- Store Manager Dashboard
- Admin Dashboard
- Superadmin Dashboard
- HQ Functional Dashboards

Exact widgets, permissions, and metrics are defined in SYSTEM_INTENT.md.
