# Clinical / Optometry Module

This module manages all clinical workflows.

Includes:
- Eye tests
- Prescription creation & history
- Optometrist-specific permissions
- Clinical compliance
- Patient linking
- Audit trails

Clinical workflows are designed to exceed industry-grade standards.
Usability is high, but compliance is non-negotiable.

Detailed flows are defined in SYSTEM_INTENT.md.
